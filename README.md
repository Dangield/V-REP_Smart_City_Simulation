# V-REP_Smart_City_Simulation
Project for Academics

Usage:
1. Install Matlab
2. Install V-REP
3. In V-REP: File->Open Scene and select 'World_1.ttt' file.

To test Matlab<->V-REP connection:

4. Go to your V-REP instalation folder, it's name should be 'V-REP3'.
5. Go to '../V-REP_PRO_EDU/programming/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib/Windows/64Bit/' and copy file remoteApi.dll to folder '/V-REP_PRO_EDU/programming/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab/'.
6. In folder '../V-REP_PRO_EDU/programming/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab/' there are three test files: 'simpleTest.m', 'simpleSynchronousTest' and 'complexCommandTest.m'.
7. Open Matlab and V-REP
8. In V-REP open scene 'World_1.ttt' and run it.
9. Choose any of the mentioned test fiels and run it in Matlab.
